Extract and Run the `kube-bench-cis-1.5.tar.gz` file. Instructions included.

Will Need a jumpbox (not stemcell based) that has non-root access to Docker and ability to download dependencies from the internt using apt.

The Compliance Scanner will provide a more enterprise friendly way to run CIS scans on K8 using kube-bench in upcoming releases.
